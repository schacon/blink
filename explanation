Dear schacon, nevermind all of this stuff if you exist and you are person.

I am newbie an this is testing excercise for using github features.
This time I am testing pull requests.

Looks like I've succesfully forked some schacon project, cloned it and edit online and offline.
What I edit is my own personal fork, and not just my personal fork but my topic branch in it.
I can request myself and I can request schacon. Request means ask to merge branches.

That's how I'm learning and that's all.
